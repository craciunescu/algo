    7. Write a program that receives a positive number N and obtains
    the amount of prime numbers and the amount of perfect numbers there are
    between 1 and N. Analyze the efficiency and complexity of the provided
    solution.

    For this we could reuse the already defined methods in e5 and e6, but that
    would yield a highly inefficient program. We could solve this problem in two
    different ways:
    - Implementing the Sieve of Erastothenes.
    - Tweaking the implementation of e5 and e6 in order to return amounts and
      not booleans.
