    5. Program a funciton to determine if a number received as a parameter is
    prime. Analyze the efficiency and complexity of the provided solution(s).

    A prime number is a number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by
    multiplying two smaller natural numbers. As with all problems, there are
    many ways to implement this.
