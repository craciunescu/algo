        1. For a non-empty vector of non-repeating pseudo-randomly-generated
        integer values ordered in increasing order, design a divide-and-conquer
        algorithm that finds if the vector is coincident.

        A coincident vector is that in which at least one value is contained in an
        index equal to that value. An example would be: [-14, -2, 2, 4, 7, 9].
        The value 2 can be found in index [2], therefore the vector is
        coincident.

        The complexity of the provided solution should not exceed O(logn).
        Consider as inputs the vector and its size.

        Obtains if a vector is coincident in O(âˆšn) time.
