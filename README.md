# Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of common algorithms for my (obviously)
algorithms class.

Basic structure of the repo:
```
  ./number_of_unit
  |__
  |   /docs
  |   |__
  |         *.png
  |   /src
  |   |__
  |         *.py
  |   /test
  |   |__
  |         test_*.py
```

No external python libraries have been used.
From any `number_of_unit` directory, execute `python3 -m /test/test_*.py -v` to
check the results from the tests.
